This repository contains LSTM code implemented in PyTorch to predict multi-output, high-dimensional, non-stationary time series. The Smart Home with Weather Information dataset, available on Kaggle, is used for testing the model. This dataset includes time-series data of household appliance power consumption (in kW) from a smart meter and weather conditions for a specific region, spanning from January 2016 to December 2016 with a 1-minute frequency. It comprises 29 variables: 18 electricity-related, 10 weather-related, and 1 temporal feature. For this work, the original time series frequency is adjusted from 1 minute to 10 minutes.
